## Contract Architecture

### Data Structures

#### Owner Profiles
```clarity
{
  username: (string-ascii 32),
  pets-owned: uint,
  care-activities: uint,
  vet-visits: uint,
  owner-level: uint,
  join-date: uint
}
```

#### Pet Profiles
```clarity
{
  owner: principal,
  pet-name: (string-ascii 24),
  pet-type: (string-ascii 12),
  breed: (string-ascii 24),
  age-months: uint,
  weight-grams: uint,
  registration-date: uint,
  active: bool
}
```

#### Care Activities
```clarity
{
  pet-id: uint,
  caregiver: principal,
  activity-type: (string-ascii 16),
  duration-minutes: uint,
  notes: (string-ascii 64),
  activity-date: uint
}
```

#### Vet Checkups
```clarity
{
  owner: principal,
  checkup-type: (string-ascii 16),
  vet-notes: (string-ascii 128),
  next-checkup: uint,
  completed: bool
}
```

## Public Functions

### Pet Management

#### `register-pet`
```clarity
(register-pet 
  (pet-name (string-ascii 24))
  (pet-type (string-ascii 12))
  (breed (string-ascii 24))
  (age-months uint)
  (weight-grams uint))
```
Registers a new pet and returns the pet ID. Creates owner profile if first pet.

#### `update-pet-weight`
```clarity
(update-pet-weight (pet-id uint) (new-weight-grams uint))
```
Updates a pet's weight. Only callable by pet owner.

### Activity Tracking

#### `log-care-activity`
```clarity
(log-care-activity
  (pet-id uint)
  (activity-type (string-ascii 16))
  (duration-minutes uint)
  (notes (string-ascii 64)))
```
Logs a care activity and awards 1.5 PCT. Updates owner level based on duration.

**Activity Types:** "feeding", "walking", "grooming", "playing"

#### `schedule-vet-checkup`
```clarity
(schedule-vet-checkup
  (pet-id uint)
  (checkup-type (string-ascii 16))
  (vet-notes (string-ascii 128))
  (next-checkup-days uint))
```
Records a vet checkup and awards 3 PCT.

**Checkup Types:** "routine", "emergency", "vaccination"

### Profile & Rewards

#### `update-username`
```clarity
(update-username (new-username (string-ascii 32)))
```
Updates the owner's display username.

#### `claim-milestone`
```clarity
(claim-milestone (milestone (string-ascii 12)))
```
Claims a milestone achievement and awards 8 PCT. Can only be claimed once per milestone.

**Available Milestones:**
- "caregiver-20" - Requires 20+ care activities
- "vet-regular-10" - Requires 10+ vet visits
- "multi-pet-3" - Requires 3+ registered pets

### Admin Functions

#### `deactivate-pet`
```clarity
(deactivate-pet (pet-id uint))
```
Deactivates a pet profile. Owner-only function.

## Read-Only Functions

## Error Codes

| Code | Error | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| u100 | err-owner-only | Function restricted to contract owner |
| u101 | err-not-found | Resource not found |
| u102 | err-already-exists | Resource already exists |
| u103 | err-unauthorized | Caller not authorized |
| u104 | err-invalid-input | Invalid input parameters |

## Usage Examples

### Register Your First Pet
```clarity
(contract-call? .petpal register-pet 
  "Buddy" 
  "dog" 
  "Golden Retriever" 
  u24 
  u25000)
```

### Log a Care Activity
```clarity
(contract-call? .petpal log-care-activity 
  u1 
  "walking" 
  u30 
  "Morning walk in the park")
```

### Schedule a Vet Checkup
```clarity
(contract-call? .petpal schedule-vet-checkup 
  u1 
  "routine" 
  "Annual wellness check - all healthy" 
  u365)
```

### Claim a Milestone
```clarity
(contract-call? .petpal claim-milestone "caregiver-20")
```

## Tokenomics

### Reward Distribution
- **Care Activities**: Consistent rewards for daily engagement
- **Vet Checkups**: Higher rewards for health maintenance
- **Milestones**: Bonus rewards for long-term commitment

### Owner Level Progression
Owner levels increase automatically based on care activity duration:
- Every 30 minutes of care = +1 level
- Levels serve as reputation indicators in the community

## Security Considerations

1. **Ownership Verification**: All pet modifications require owner authorization
2. **Active Status Checks**: Deactivated pets cannot receive new activities
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated for non-zero values and proper lengths
4. **Supply Cap**: Token minting limited to 40,000 PCT maximum
5. **Milestone Protection**: One-time milestone claims prevent double-claiming

## Development Roadmap

### Potential Enhancements
- Social features (pet playdates, community events)
- NFT integration for pet profiles
- Reward marketplace (exchange PCT for pet supplies)
- Veterinarian verification system
- Pet health records integration
- Cross-pet statistics and leaderboards
